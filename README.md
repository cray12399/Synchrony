# Synchrony - WIP

## What is this?
Synchrony is a work in progress app that will allow the user to sync their Android phone with their PC over bluetooth. My ultimate goal for this project is to make it so that the user never has to look at their phone when it is connected to their computer, as well as provide other useful functionalities. Some planned/already implemented features include:

- **Multi-Device support:** Sync data with as many devices as your phone can handle. If you have multiple computers, all of them will concurrently receive communication from the app.
- **Text Messaging:** Send and receive text messages directly from your PC without ever having to pick up your phone.
- **Manage Phone Calls:** Make and take calls directly from your PC without ever having to pick up your phone.
- **Share Clipboard:** Share you clipboards between your phone and PC with the press of a button.
-  **Exchange Files:** Send and receive files between devices over bluetooth without having to use a cable.
- **Use Your Phone as an Input Device:** Use your phone as a mouse and keyboard for your PC.
- **Remotely Control Your Phone:** Remotely control your phone over bluetooth, similarly to the way that SCRCPY works.
- **ADB Functionality:** Easy use of ADB over bluetooth to provide additional functionalities such as backups, package installation, debugging, etc.
- **Cross-Platform Support:** Right now, the app is in development for Linux, but I plan to make it compatible with every operating system.
- **Privacy:** Unlike services provided by the big name developers like Google, Apple, Samsung, etc. such as iMessage, this app does not need to share data with a third-party in order to function, and your data will be kept to your devices only. This app will also remain open source for the entirety of its existence.
